# The Geotab Ecosystem: A Primer for Hackathon Participants

**What if your hackathon project could reach 5 million vehicles?**

The Geotab Marketplace is where fleet solutions find real users. Over 350 companies distribute their products here—reaching 100,000 customers without building their own sales team. Your prototype today could be in front of fleet managers tomorrow.

This primer shows you what's possible.

## They Started Small Too

These developers began with simple ideas. Now they're reaching millions of vehicles.

### GoAnalytics: From Reseller to Order Now Partner

**The founder** spent 14 years as a Geotab reseller before building his own product.

**The start:** Simple dashboards to visualize key metrics at a glance.

**The growth:**
> "Our original product began with simple dashboards designed to visualize key metrics at a glance. But innovation doesn't happen in a vacuum. Through constant conversations with customers and partners — including deep collaboration with Geotab — we evolved rapidly."

**Today:** Order Now partner (highest tier). One of only 3 software solutions launched on Order Now in January 2025. 5-star rated.

### LifeSaver Mobile: Two Dads Worried About Their Kids

**The problem:** Co-founders Ted Chen and Mike Demele had teenage sons learning to drive. They were worried about phone distraction.

> "This generation was raised with phones in their hands, and eliminating that distraction while driving was a serious concern."

**The solution:** 100% software—no hardware required. Prevents phone use while driving.

**The validation:** 50+ million miles of driving data.

**The results for customers:**
- **25-50% reduction** in at-fault collisions
- **50% drop** in annual fleet insurance claims

**Today:** Premier Partner. Their interest was confirmed at Geotab Connect 2020 when they saw strong responses from resellers and customers.

### Whip Around: Founded 2016, Now Premier Partner

**The product:** Electronic DVIR (driver vehicle inspection reports), work orders, maintenance scheduling.

**The journey:** Started in 2016. Built integration with Geotab Drive app. Achieved Premier Partner status.

**Customer results:**
- "Over **30% per month in savings** after putting Whip Around into play"
- "Saves us **tens of thousands of dollars a year**"

> "We are honored to reach Premier Partner status as we strive to collaborate with key partners such as Geotab."
> — Noah Hickey, CEO

## From Idea to Product: More Examples

### Cameras That Pay for Themselves

**Lytx Surfsight** — AI-powered dashcam integrated into MyGeotab.

A customer deployed Geotab GO devices with Surfsight cameras. Result: **30% reduction in insurance premiums ($45,000/year saved)**. The cameras paid for themselves.

**What you could build:** An AI that detects distracted driving, tailgating, or near-misses from dashcam footage.

---

### Maintenance That Prevents Breakdowns

**Fleetio** — Syncs with Geotab for automated odometer updates and fault code alerts. When Geotab detects a check engine light, Fleetio automatically creates a work order.

Connects to **100,000+ maintenance shops** across the US.

**What you could build:** A predictive model that says "this vehicle will break down in 2 weeks" based on engine data patterns.

---

### Collision Reconstruction in Real-Time

**Xtract360** — Digital incident reporting with instant collision reconstruction. Shows damage, cost, and liability analysis.

**Order Now partner** (January 2025 launch). Transforms paper-based claims to digital.

**What you could build:** An InsurTech tool that automatically generates claims reports from telematics data.

---

### Safety That Transforms Culture

**White Cap + Holman** — Construction company with 600+ vehicles.

Results with Geotab + cameras + coaching:
- **97% reduction** in speeding violations
- **97% reduction** in seatbelt violations
- **62% reduction** in aggressive driving

**What you could build:** A gamified safety leaderboard that rewards good driving with real incentives.

---

### Analytics That Find Money

**City of Miami Gardens** — Used Geotab data to optimize their fleet.

Results:
- **$60,000+ annually** in operational savings
- **$1.1 million** from vehicle resales (right-sizing the fleet)

**What you could build:** A "fleet advisor" that spots underused vehicles, recommends replacements, and calculates ROI.

---

### EV Transition Planning

**Enterprise Fleet Management** — Geotab analyzed **91,252 vehicles** for EV readiness.

Findings:
- **13%** could switch to EVs today (saving $33 million)
- **45%** could switch once electric pickups arrive (saving $167 million)
- **1.3 million tons** of CO2 reduction

**What you could build:** An EV suitability calculator that shows which vehicles should go electric first.
