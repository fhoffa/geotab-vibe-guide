# Annotated Examples

**Real-world Geotab Add-Ins, broken down so you can learn from them.**

This folder contains detailed walkthroughs of working Add-Ins. Each guide takes an Add-In apart piece by piece, explaining what it does, why it works that way, and what patterns you can reuse in your own projects.

## Available Examples

| Example | Author | What It Does | Key Patterns |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [Cold Chain Historical View](COLD_CHAIN_HISTORICAL_VIEW.md) | [Majdi Ben Hassen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/majdi-ben-hassen-48300996/) | Temperature monitoring with charts, PDF, and Excel export | `multiCall` batching, group filtering, i18n, multi-zone signals, export workflows |

## How to Use These Guides

1. **Read the walkthrough** to understand how the Add-In works
2. **Try it yourself** by pasting the configuration into MyGeotab
3. **Modify it** using the "Make It Your Own" prompts at the end
4. **Build something new** using the patterns you learned
